ActivityIndicator is a singleton class that displays an activity indicator with customizable options such as style, color, and background color. It is useful for showing loading or processing states in your app.

Usage
To use the ActivityIndicator class in your app, simply call the show method to display the activity indicator, and the hide method to hide it.

Here's an example of how to use the ActivityIndicator class:

// Show the activity indicator
ActivityIndicator.shared.show()

// Do some processing...
// ...

// Hide the activity indicator
ActivityIndicator.shared.hide()


You can also customize the activity indicator by passing in optional parameters to the show method. For example:

// Show a small red activity indicator with a clear background
ActivityIndicator.shared.show(style: .small, color: .red, backgroundColor: .clear)


// Show a small red activity indicator with a clear background
ActivityIndicator.shared.show(style: .small, color: .red, backgroundColor: .clear)


Customization
The show method takes three optional parameters for customizing the activity indicator:

style: The style of the activity indicator. Defaults to .large.
color: The color of the activity indicator. Defaults to .white.
backgroundColor: The background color of the view that contains the activity indicator. Defaults to a semi-transparent black color.
